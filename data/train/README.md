# Training Data

Important:
These are visually verified recordings in which all NBHF signals in the database file are assumed to have been produced by the observed species at the time of the recording.

Recordings that are intended to be labelled as Dall's porpoise (*Phocoenoides dalli*) must include the pattern '*Dalls*' in their file name, e.g. 'data/db/Bangarang_**Dalls**.sqlite3'

The same applies to the other NBHF species that are labelled in this dataset:
- *Kogia* spp. (*Kogiidae*) should include the pattern '*Ksp*'
- Harbor porpoise (*Phocoena phocoena*) should include the pattern '*Harbor*'
